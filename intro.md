Scott Susin is the founder of the [Center for Mortgage Access](https://mortgageaccesscenter.com/),
a policy research organization dedicated to the role of public mortgage finance in expanding equitable 
access to homeownership.  Previously, he served as a Senior Economist 
at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the primary regulator of 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There, he focused on analyzing disparities in mortgage 
interest rates and home appraisals. Scott has also worked at HUD’s Office of 
Systemic Investigations, where he led econometric analysis for two of the agency’s largest fair 
lending settlements, including the then-largest redlining settlement in the U.S.

Scott’s research has been published in leading academic journals and covered in national media, 
academic handbooks, and textbooks. His studies have explored statistical methods for calculating the 
damages and the effects of subsidized housing on house prices and employment.
